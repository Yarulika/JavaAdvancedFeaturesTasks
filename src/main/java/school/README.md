Task from Ahmad:
 create students
 each student should have name, age and address
 each student will study 5 subjects & it should be unique
 each subject will have degree
 if student gets less than 50 - it is fail, otherwise - pass
 school has 10 subjects

 0 - each student has method register subjects
 1 - sort students by degree (use comparable class)
 2 - get students ordered by object creation time

    // student: name, age, address [in list]
    // subjects [in set]: 5 unique per each student
    // subject: degree (< 50 is fail; >= 50 is pass)
    // school: 10 subjects
    //
    // student: method register course
    // sort students by SUM degree
    // order students by creation time
    // when do they get degree
    //
    // use ENUMS
    // use comparable class
    // Collections.sort // implement comparable
    // Person implements Comparable(Person)
